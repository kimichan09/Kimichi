Hi, Ms. Ayi. Good morning.
Good morning.
Hi, ma'am. Can you hear me clearly, po?
Yes.
Yes. And can you also see my screen, po, ma'am?
Yes.
All right. That's great to hear. So again, good morning, Ms. Ayi. My name is Arlene.
I'm the head of the sales and administration for ACES Solar Corporation.
And here with us is also our account manager, who's Ivy, who's handling your account, po.
So I'll be conducting the presentation. This will only take 30 minutes.
If you have any questions, po, just feel free to interrupt me and I'll be more than happy to answer it.
All right.
Okay.
Great. So Ms. Ayi, before we start, let me know, po, let me ask a few questions.
Why are we interested, po, with Solar?
So I came from the U.S. So solar energy is heavily pushed,
especially in my state, where I came from, which is California.
Actually, my goal is by 2040, there will be no more gas, vehicles, all electric.
But it makes sense for me to invest here solar energy.
Number one, it's hot. It's always sunny.
So it's like year round.
Even if there's a change, yes.
But it's still hot after noon.
So year round, it's always sunny.
So it makes sense, you know.
So you just want to harness the sun, produce energy.
And also, it's not beyond us.
You know, electricity costs a lot here.
I would say 15% of somebody's salary goes to power consumption.
And because it's hot, everybody now has air conditioning, even if it's hot outside.
As for me, I have four babies and they tend to get overheat a lot.
So they can't stand the heat even if they go out for a while in the garage.
They don't want to. They just want to come back in.
Because I'm especially double-coated, so it's hot in their body.
So mostly here at home, the air conditioner is always open, especially when it's super hot outside.
And most of the time, the air conditioner is open for 24 hours, especially when we stay at home.
So it's something, you know, it's a no-brainer.
You know, it's a no-brainer for me to put a solar power in the house.
And also for me, because, you know, at real estate, I invest, I think, putting a solar power,
a house that is powered by solar as well, adding value to the house, you know.
So it adds value to the house.
So it's more attractive to buyers in the future.
So it's a good investment, I think.
It's intense for me, just the environment I'm living in right now.
So it really makes sense.
Okay, that's great to hear.
Well, actually, that's correct, ma'am.
Normally, the clients that are interested in solar,
is basically they see how good this is as an investment.
So it's true, especially ma'am, you're from the U.S.
So of course, our body heat, most of our clients are really from the U.S.
They can't handle the heat here.
Yes, it's true, ma'am.
Maybe because, really, we have a client that they don't turn off the air conditioner anymore.
Maybe it's because of the global warming, I'll add to that.
Same with me.
Same with me.
But in the U.S., it's really cold, even if it's morning, it's cold.
I guess, yes, that's correct, ma'am.
I definitely agree.
It's a good investment, especially with the lifestyle that we have.
The air conditioner is really a necessity now.
It's because of the environment that we have.
That's right, ma'am.
And of course, the high cost of electricity.
So like what you said, it's really a no-brainer that we have to invest in solar.
And it's good that we have you here right now.
We get to explain.
And I think since you're already familiar with Solar, ma'am,
we'll just speed up the presentation.
Probably we'll just focus on our projects and the products that we are using in case you go with Aces Solar.
All right.
And just add it to that.
Because also, I grew up here, right?
But half of my life, I moved to the U.S.
I grew up here, most of my adult life.
And going back, the heat before is not like now.
It's really super hot.
Even when I walked in the middle of the street, I was fine.
I was young.
Yes, that's true.
I can't.
I can't stand it anymore.
Because it hurts my skin, it hurts my head.
The heat is different.
The heat is really different.
So it's just, you know, especially in the house.
The house here is cement.
Because it's always, you know, not disaster, calamity.
If the house is made of wood, it's okay, right?
So it makes sense to the houses here in Mento, right?
Which is, sometimes it's really hot.
You know, the house is really quiet.
So it's really hot.
Yes.
So it is something to do with that as well.
That's why I should have started this when I was young.
While I was doing the...
Because I had a new house, but I couldn't make it.
But I've been doing a lot.
I wish I could have told Adel about the small renovation.
I just couldn't keep up.
I mean, the cost of renovation and everything,
it cost a lot in the budget.
That's true.
There's no fixed amount.
You really have to adjust.
To put something...
Sometimes, I didn't like the aftermath of the renovation.
It turned over to your house.
So I had to fix it.
So the majority of the funds should go to solar,
to the renovation of the house.
I mean, it's a brand new house.
I cannot live in a brand new house with this situation, right?
But besides from that, it's supposed to be bought.
It's just like that.
I just realized it now.
That's all.
Another fact is sometimes...
I know you guys are busy.
Sometimes, when I inquire online,
no one answers.
It's a high volume.
We're really sorry about that.
Also, it's amazing.
The house is small.
They have solar.
I know somebody's house.
But the house has solar.
I think it really saves consumption
when it comes to energy, especially during the day.
That's true, ma'am.
Especially from you, ma'am.
For sure, my aircon is 24x7.
If you don't mind me asking, ma'am,
how much is your monthly bill?
So for the past...
Hold on. May, June, July, August.
So for the past three months,
the average is 11,000.
11,000.
And with that,
what are the ACs that are running during daytime?
How many horsepower is that, ma'am?
2.5.
Mostly in the living room.
But, of course, I have a refrigerator.
I have a washer and dryer.
And mostly, every other day,
I do the laundry in the washer and dryer.
Because I have dogs.
So they get angry.
They get angry.
That's true.
They have blankets.
They want blankets.
So every other day, I do the laundry.
And I have a humidifier that runs 24x7.
And then I also have water refill...
What is water?
Water dispenser.
That runs 24x7.
It also has a purifier.
So water must be available all the time.
That's great.
Okay.
All right.
Well, thank you for sharing that.
And thank you for answering my question, Ms. Ayi.
So what I'll do now is I'll go ahead with my presentation.
And then along with it,
I'll go ahead and give you my recommendation
based on the information that you provided.
All right?
Okay.
So I'll go ahead and start.
Again, we are AC Solar Corporation, Ms. Ayi.
We go by name AC Solar.
To give you a brief background,
AC Solar has been in the industry since 2017.
And we have two offices.
We have our satellite office,
which is in BF Homes, Paranaque.
This is our mini sales office.
And this is our warehouse.
We're in also an office warehouse,
which is located in Las Pi√±as.
So we are a legit registered company.
We are also a PCAB license contractor,
both for private as well as for government projects.
So we offer a different type of system.
So I'm sure you're very familiar with this.
So we offer three type of system,
off-grid, grid-tie, and hybrid.
So what are the difference of the three?
So off-grid is basically recommended
in standalone areas,
which is in the mountains,
where we don't have electricity.
Next is grid-tie.
Grid-tie is what is commonly recommended in our area
since we have a stable power source.
So there.
This is how it looks like.
So for grid-tie,
your primary source during daytime is solar.
If it's not enough,
it will draw from Neralco.
So no fluctuation.
Everything is seamless.
Now what's good with grid-tie
is that it will reduce your electricity bill,
much affordable,
faster return of investment,
and like what you mentioned,
increase the value of your property.
And to help the environment,
it will reduce the carbon footprint.
However, there's a downside of it.
What's the downside?
Since it doesn't have a battery,
in case of power interruption,
whether it's daytime,
you don't have power as well.
Because like what I mentioned, there's no battery.
That's why it is recommended
if you have a stable power source.
And I'm sure,
you staying here in the Philippines, ma'am,
how many times have we experienced
the brownout?
Me personally,
we only experienced it
if it's a super typhoon,
which is normally an hour,
maybe it's maxed out a day.
But based on the experience,
it only browns out once or twice a year.
Or if there's
rotational brownout,
which is rarely happening now.
So that is for grid-tie.
Now for
hybrid,
hybrid is what is
having the best of both worlds.
You're tied up with grid.
And in case of power interruption,
you have backup.
So normally, if we have clients
where they have a demand
in power that they can't lose
power,
we can go ahead and
recommend this one.
For this one, since you have battery,
of course,
the pros of this
is it will still reduce your electricity bill.
It will avoid power interruption
in case for critical
loads. So critical loads
meaning to say these are the basic
appliances only, like fans,
lights, probably the
internet.
And another thing is it will still reduce
your carbon footprint and then increase the value
of your property. However,
the only downside of that is
higher upfront cost.
This is because of the battery.
This is our battery.
So it's higher maintenance
since we have battery.
But then again, the good side
is there is no power interruption
for you, for your critical loads.
Any questions so far,
Ms. Aiye?
No, so far so good.
Now, these are
the sample projects that we had.
So we cater NCR, some parts of Calabarzon,
as well as Centralozon.
So any type of roof pole we can
install. Do you have an idea
Ms. Aiye? What type of roof do we have?
What do we have?
The second?
Yes, ma'am.
It's just flat.
Okay, it's just metal, ma'am.
No, it's cement.
Cement, okay.
So what is that, ma'am?
Is it like a rooftop?
Yes.
It's not like a rooftop.
This is a 3rd floor, but we only have 2 doors.
So on the 3rd floor,
the chef is on the 3rd floor.
The chef is on the 3rd floor.
There's no roof, ma'am.
It's just like a roof pole.
But it's not air, it's cement.
The whole thing is cement?
Yes.
Do you have any plans?
For example, we have clients
who are in, if they have
cemented roof, ma'am,
they want to utilize the space.
Sometimes we
build the structure frame
so we can use the bottom.
Or do you want it like
roof-mounted, ma'am?
Or ground-mounted on the roof?
I mean, I don't have any plans
to build a rooftop.
I mean, even if it's small,
I'm just imagining it.
Well, what about if
there's a bungalow?
I don't really see a point in putting a rooftop there
because the stairs should be narrow.
So I wouldn't even
bother putting it there.
Basically, I don't go there.
I wouldn't even bother going there.
Might as well just use that for solar.
Actually,
I'm really reserving
that space for solar.
That's great.
Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Ai.
These are the sample projects
of our residential.
This is the top view.
For our commercial, these are the sample projects.
And for
industrial
and another industrial
projects.
Now,
of course, aside from the solar panels,
what you see
on your house are the inverters or
the batteries. So in case we
are opting for hybrid,
this is how it looks like. So everything
is wall-mounted so that it is
space-savorable.
So this is the sample of the hybrid.
This is the sample of the grid type.
Now,
why should you choose ACES Solar?
So first is after-sale
support. I believe also
as a consumer, it is very important
that the company or if there's a company
that will be purchasing something, there should
be an after-sale support.
So why? Because in case
any issues that will arise, I want to make sure
that it will be resolved promptly.
So you can rest assured that our company
is trained and well equipped to support any
concerns. Plus, there are multiple
ways for you to reach us in case there's an issue
that will arise. You can reach us on our
page, on our number.
We can also give our personal number in case
you need anything that
is urgent. So second
is premium components, meaning to say
we only use Tier 1 brands.
So these are the brands that went through proper
testing, certified, and UL listed.
So again, at the end of the day, we don't
want to use substandard because it can
cost firepower. Now third is
trusted contractor. So right now
in the market, if you search for solar
contractors, there is really a lot of
solar contractors or solar providers.
However, only few are
legit. So rest assured
that our company is a fully registered
company and a licensed member of Philippine
Contractors Accreditation Board.
Because again, at the end of the day,
this is a long-term warranty
ma'am. So we have 12, we have
20, and 25. So you
want to make sure that if there's
an issue that will arise, we have
a company that will pay us back.
Now, earlier
I mentioned that we only use premium components.
So we carry different brands of
panels to give
options to our clients.
Alright, for our standard,
what we're using is Longi, which is
made in China with 12 years product
warranty.
All of the panels that we are using
are monocrystalline panels.
And for our
premium, what we're using is
PhonoSolar, which is bi-facial,
which offers
20 years product warranty with
30 years performance warranty.
So basically, for
this type of panel, minimum lifespan
is 30 years.
It's a double glass, diamond glass.
Now for our third, what we're
using is SunPower. I'm sure you're familiar
with this because this is a known brand in
US.
So SunPower is a US
brand with 25 years product warranty
and 25 years performance
warranty.
So the pricing varies depending on the brand
of the solar panel that you will be
availing. Now aside
from the solar panel, another major
component is the inverters.
So the inverters
is like the CPU of your computer.
So for GridTie, what we're
using is SunWaze or DAI,
which both offers 5 years
product warranty.
Now for our
hybrid, what we're using is
LuxPower, which offers 5
years product warranty and
Lithium Battery from
Dynest, which offers 10 years product
warranty. So that's why our hybrid
is expensive and it's because we're already
using Lithium Battery.
So with a minimum lifespan of 10
years as well.
Now, what's
good with our system is that
once we install it,
we can monitor it. So we have
web-based as well as app-based
wherein you can download on your phone.
So let's just say we're
going to use GridTie, this is how it looks
like. So
it's a multi-user from
even if you are in states,
you will be able to see the house
consumption of your house,
how much the solar generates
and if you are drawing from
Miralco.
And then from here you will see
the daily savings, the monthly,
yearly and from the time it was installed.
And at the bottom
you will see the hourly.
So
this one is for hybrid.
So the only difference is
the battery.
You will see if it's charging or
discharging and also since it has
battery, the monitoring is 24-7.
Hence
from GridTie
since at night
it's night and there's no power
it will automatically
sleep mode our inverter.
Okay.
Alright, now
is solar high maintenance? No.
Actually
it's less maintenance when we say about the
cleaning and system checkup.
Recommended is at least once
a year unless we are in
an exposed area.
So
for this one
the annual maintenance fee is
three thousand or five hundred
per kilowatt. So minimum of
three thousand whichever is higher.
Assuming that we're getting a six kilowatt
system then that's going to be a three
thousand. So six kilowatt and below
three thousand pesos po yung
annual fee. So you don't have to worry.
Every year we will call you
to remind you regarding with the preventive
maintenance. Okay.
That's good. That's good because the summer things
going on sometimes you forget.
Yes, true. So
one less worry off your back. We will
reach out in case your system
is due for system checkup.
Okay. Now common question
po is pa na pag may baguio bakali
parein?
Yan. So lagi ko pong sagot
pag kaya pang tanggalin ng baguio yung
bubung nyo, tanggal din po si solar panels.
So the reason behind
it is because naka drill po
yung purlins sa roof.
In your case po, since
it's a memento po siya, I think
we will have to check
because there's a special mounting that we are
going to use for this type of
roof. Unlike with yung mga
normal na long span or yung mga
tiles. So
basically we want to make sure na
the solar panels will
not be flown away in case there's a typhoon.
But
our solar panels can withstand
up to 200 kph.
Up to 250 kph.
Normally naman po ma'am, based on our
experience for the past
6 years, wala pa naman
nililipad na solar panels.
Kasi hindi naman tayo umaabot dito
sa Manila ng ganung kalakas yung
wind kahit may super typhoon.
There. Now wala din po
dyan mga ngalawang
kasi po aluminum roof mounting
ang gamit natin and stainless po
ang mga screws. Now
third question is pa na pag may
leak? So
type of your roof, normally ma'am
we require a waterproofing.
So during the
site visit, we will have
to check on the roof kung meron siyang waterproofing.
And then if there's
a need for reapply, then we
will have to reapply po to make sure
that there will be no leaks.
So
yan po. So normally in a
normal roof setup,
bago po yung pumasok, meron niyang
silad. And then in between, meron
po yung rubber seal. And then on top,
meron po ulit yan silad.
So that's why we also recommend
at least once a year to check on
your system to check if there's a
need for resealad po. But
what we're using naman po is a uberated
sealant which is known as vulka
seal or elastosil po.
There. Now all of
the wirings po, so our wirings will be
from your solar panel going to the inverter,
inverter going to your breaker.
So all of the wirings
will be inside an HDPE
which is built for outdoor.
Uberated po siya. Minimum
lifespan is 50 years.
So yan.
So safe po yung mga wirings natin. No
discoloration po for that type of pipe
unlike with PVC yung color orange
po. Yan di po siya
magdi discoloration.
Alright. Now
with the build that you mentioned earlier
that is 11,000 with 2.5
horsepower running, washer dryer
every other day.
Again we can start
with 5 or 6 kilowatt.
Okay.
To give you an idea po, a 6 kilowatt system
is can generate
up to 720 kilowatt
hour on a daily basis
or on a monthly basis rather
or 24 kilowatt hour
per day. So
it can cover your air
cone which is 2.5 horsepower
plus the basic household appliances
and if you're
using dryer. Now pag kinulang
naman po again, Meralco will kick
in. So
yan po siya. So
pag example, yung actual
consumption, for just the month
of August 22 up to
September 21st
610
kilowatts. Okay.
So
610 kilowatt hour combination
of day and night.
Right.
So actually
if this is just
a daytime consumption, a 5 kilowatt
system will do. But since
this is a day and night consumption
we have
to have this option
wherein it is net metering.
So I'm sure you're familiar with this kasi sa US
parang automatic siya
wherein you sell your excess harvest
to the grid and then
in return you'll get rebates.
Can you give me a moment?
Okay. Give me a moment.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So,
oh my gosh.
Oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
Yes, because it's soft. That's why I often work here. Especially at night. I usually do my laundry at night because I'm there in the morning with my businesses.
But sometimes my aunties are here so they take care of them. So the aircon is 24 hours.
That's why. Yes, the coat of gold is also thick. That's why they really need it.
That's why they need it. Sometimes it doesn't come out when it's hot inside.
Yes, that's true. So actually ma'am, we have a client. She just got a solar. Her height is chow-chow.
Yes, it's thinner. It's thicker.
Her solar was triggered because it's like the parent of all her chow-chow died.
In the heat. Yes, in the heat. That's why she got a solar.
So that's the reason. Sometimes the dogs are the reason.
It's their fault that they have two dogs. No, I'm kidding. I added two dogs to the house.
But that's also serious, mommy. Of course, the distress that it will give us.
So when I get home, you think it's been a long time since I've been away.
Yes, that's true.
I'm so happy when I get home. I'm happy inside.
They're happier compared to our children, right ma'am?
You know I don't have a child. So I can have all the time in the world that I can take care of them.
They're brunts. They're brunts.
But they're so cool.
They're very smart. They're smart. They're sweet. They like kids.
They like kids. And sometimes kids get scared because they're big, right?
Because they're big. But they're playful and golden.
They're really playful. They're brunts.
When they know it's time to go home, when they know they need to relax, they'll relax.
When they grow up, they'll sit down to work. They'll play alone.
Or they're just gonna sleep. That's it.
That's right, ma'am. That's true.
It's really fun when there's a dog. Anyway, ma'am.
So since there are times when you're not there, even if you're not there, the aircon is still open.
So probably this is something that you may want to consider as well.
Net meeting, although this is just optional.
But just in case you want to compensate your nighttime consumption, this is also an avenue for you.
So net meeting is giving you the option to sell your excess harvest to Miralco.
So for this one, normally it's three to six months processing.
The six to eight months was during the pandemic time.
So for Miralco right now, I think their charge is 13 pesos.
So Miralco's net metered is around seven pesos.
So six to seven pesos.
So it's almost more than half unlike before, which is around 50 percent.
So how does it work?
So your exported energy will be computed multiplied on their rate.
And then it will be deducted on the imported energy.
So in case we sold more, of course we'll get a zero bill.
But again, this is good if we're strong at night.
Like what you mentioned, our aircon is 24-7, ma'am.
This could be an option for you.
So the good thing about Solar is you can start small.
But again, if you have the budget to go bigger, we can also do that.
But if we have a budget that we are looking at two or at two, then again, it's better if we can start small.
And then we apply for net metering.
And then we see if we still want to get a zero bill, we can always increase.
That's the good thing about Solar.
Just to cut you off a little bit.
So the house has four ACs.
So each AC room has one plus living room.
So the two bedrooms, that's it.
And then for my bedroom, it's two horsepower.
And one of the visitors is also here.
They sleep here.
Most of the time, my parents are here.
They like to sleep here.
Because I don't have one anymore.
They sleep here.
So I don't have two bedrooms.
Or sometimes my aunts have two bedrooms.
So sometimes they also use the ACs in other rooms.
Okay.
Alright.
Well again, we can give you an option ma'am.
The good thing about Solar is that we are on our anniversary sale promo.
And our rates are really high.
So like for example, before our 10 kilowatt is at 395.
Now it's at 370.
And that is already for premium package ma'am.
So I think the promo right now for our anniversary sale promo is our premium package is lower than the standard price.
I see that.
I would touch that later because you're not the only.
I'll be honest with you.
You're not the only Solar company I'm talking to.
There are a lot of you.
But so far, the best offer I've seen is ACES.
That's great to hear ma'am.
Alright.
Now for Netme Tiring, again this is just optional.
This is on top of the package.
It's 39,575.
It's an end-to-end process.
Meaning to say we just have to get some requirements from you and then we will process it on our end.
But you can also process it on your own.
We will provide the basic documents that are needed for you to apply the Netme Tiring.
Like the electrical plan, the certificates of the equipment, and then the plan parameter and COC.
Okay.
Now in case we are considering Netme Tiring, I'm hoping and praying that our Meralco meter is in front of our house.
Yes, it is.
Okay.
Perfect.
Now since this is a new house, I believe we have this.
There's a gray box under the meter.
Alright.
Yeah.
Okay.
Great.
Is our garage covered on the side of our Meralco meter?
Yes.
Perfect.
Okay.
Now the reason I asked is because this will be our tapping point.
Meaning to say from the solar panel going to the inverter, inverter going to this one.
Why?
Because it's preparation for Netme Tiring.
This is how it looks like once it is Netme Tiring.
And Meralco requires an exposed pipe from the inverter going to the meter.
Yes.
So to avoid, of course our house is new, aesthetic-wise, we want to make sure that we will bring the inverter
going to the meter so that our exposed pipe is less exposed.
Yes.
Perfect.
So again, we will not have any issues since we have this and then covered naman po yung
area natin or yung garage natin.
Covered siya.
Covered siya.
Okay.
Great.
Now for six kilowatt system, I think we already sent out a quotation.
If not, IV who's handling your account po will be the one to send the quotations.
We can send you six, eight, ten.
You can choose from there po.
So for our payment terms, it's 50% down payment upon contract signing.
Upon turnover is the balance.
We accept cash, check, bank transfer so that the promo will apply.
If we are using credit card, we will follow the regular price po.
Okay.
Now in case you have Metro Bank or PS Bank, it can be done in installment.
And our lead time po is seven to ten days upon contract signing depending on the volume
of our projects.
It can go faster or it can go more than that po.
But as much as possible, it's within the lead time normally naman po.
Okay.
Now in case we are looking at eight kilowatt or below, the installation is only one to
two days.
Technically, the next day you're already reaping the benefit of the solar.
We are already energizing it.
You can enjoy using it.
But if it's ten to twelve kilowatt po, two to three days, if it's fifteen to fifteen
and up, it can go three to four days or higher po.
Okay.
So the process is after this, we will be sending you quotation po.
Now in case you are okay with our price, we can schedule the final inspection and then
we can go on contract signing naman po.
So for contract signing, it can be done in in person or online and then you can deposit
the payment to our bank account.
From there po, we will give you once the payment is confirmed, we will schedule you for the
installation.
We will send you an installation confirmation via email and then we will do the installation
po.
Okay.
So yun lang naman po ma'am.
Again, this is our information.
Ivy will be in touch with you after this po ma'am so that we can send you the quotation.
And do you have any more questions for Ms. Ivy?
Yes.
So going back na about sa mga solar companies na nakausip ko.
So Solaric, ACES, and Go Solar.
Actually Go Solar came here to do inspection as well.
So yeah, they check the meter outside, they already have a place for the inverter, you
know.
So medyo hi-tech nga sila kasi may drone sila eh.
May lang din kami ma'am, don't worry.
Siyempre.
I mean, going back, magaling yung engineer na nakausip ko yung nagkuta niyo na nag-inspect.
However, medyo mayroong mga hindi lang talaga na-qualify.
So for example, you said you did installation in the Calabarzone area, de ba?
Sabi mo?
Yes.
And nakapag-install na ba?
Mayroong na ba kayong mga naging business dito sa Valenzuela or anything?
Yes ma'am.
Mayroong na po.
Madami dami na po.
So house kasi mayroong isa, like Solaric for example, they actually told me about occupancy
permit.
Do you need that?
For net metering, yes.
Net metering.
But their actual installation hindi?
No.
That's why I'm saying kasi alam ko bahay na to eh.
It's a house that's not being built.
So hindi na siya ginagawa.
Nakatayo na yung bahay.
And it's a residential bakit kailangan ng occupancy permit?
Yes.
Inang inaano ko kasi.
Pero yung mga panggit na yun, kayo na maglalakad noon.
Pag kayo yung pinalakad ko.
Let's say mabubayad ako.
For occupancy permit ma'am, this is provided by the LGU.
Normally, if you bought the house from a developer, they should provide you the occupancy permit.
Okay.
Yun po, nanggagaling talaga yan pe client ma'am.
We can send you a sample.
Kasi normally, before you move into the house,
after having the building permit,
70% na yan ma'am.
Di ba ma'am, permanent na yung connection nyo sa Meralco?
Yes.
Ano yan ma'am?
Existing house?
Or new, parang built from down?
Build from down.
Okay.
So kung permanent na ma'am, yung Meralco nyo,
hindi kayo magkakaroon ng permanent kasi ma'am na Meralco meter
nang wala kayong occupancy permit.
So probably, you may want to ask your developer about it.
Kasi tina-answer na sa name ko eh.
Kasi yung una, yung una nasa pangalan ng developer neto.
So you may want to ask ma'am kasi,
importante ang occupancy permit.
I think most of the clients that I've been talking to,
hindi siya masyado napapansin kasi normally yan yung pinaka last part.
Pero the fact na meron na po kayong Meralco meter na permanent,
meron na kayong occupancy permit kasi hindi po yan ipa-permanent ni Meralco
pag wala kayong occupancy permit.
So yan ma'am, nanggagalim yan sa developer nyo kasi kinukuha po yan kay LGU.
Now, we will be only needing the occupancy permit if we are going to apply for net metering.
Yes, pero if we are not going to apply for net metering,
no need po for any requirements.
Of course, I want to sell whatever I'm harvesting.
Sayang ano.
Yes, totoo ma'am.
So yun siya ma'am.
For that, you may want to tap your developer kasi usually yung mga clients namin,
hindi siya napapansin.
But we can send you a sample so that you have an idea.
But it's a meme eh.
Kailangan siya.
Ma-overlook siya ng client pero kailangan siya.
So there's also one question kasi,
I'm not sure ko anong hiningi sa'kin kasi ang hiningi sa'kin nung
kasi may pinalakad ako na tao para itransfer yung name ko sa Meralco,
yung bahay sa trauma itransfer yung Meralco sa name ko,
from the developer is,
wala siyang hiningi ok pa si permit sa'kin ang hiningi niya lang transfer,
yung title ng bahay.
Yes, opo.
Yun lang eh.
Sa Meralco ma'am, actually sobrang dali lang ng requirements.
The only requirements from Meralco is just the photo of your house,
your title, your bill, your ID and then the application.
The occupancy permit, the one who requires that is the LGU kasi pag sa net metering ma'am,
ang application natin is we go to Meralco,
Meralco will issue a yellow card, si yellow card dadalin mo siya kay LGU
so that LGU will issue CFEI.
So once the LGU issued a CFEI, before they can issue that ma'am,
they will ask you for the tax declaration, tax receipt, occupancy permit.
Pag na-provide natin yun ma'am, that's the time we go back to Meralco
para ibigay yung CFEI na-inition ni LGU.
So for net metering ma'am, we have Meralco, LGU, Meralco and then ERC.
ERC po yung final stop natin.
So gano'n siya ma'am.
Yun ang process.
Okay, next question po.
Is sino mag-handle nyan, kayo?
Kami ma'am.
Yes.
If you're going to hire us, yun po yung fee na sinabi ko kanina.
But there will be requirements that we will be requiring from you.
What I'll do ma'am, is I'll have IV sent you also the list of the requirements
and that way you can check din po.
Okay, sige, sige, sige.
Para mahanda kayo.
But since marami nang nagpunta,
since may nagpunta na sa inya ma'am, nag-inquire na kayo from other companies,
ilang kilowatt po ang inaay natin?
So sakin kasi ang inaay ko is six.
Pero sabi mo, you can start with five, diba?
Yes.
So kasi ang inaano ko dito yung pag mas maraming sabay-sabay nabukas ng AC, alam mo yun?
Pinanghabo ko kasi doon eh.
Dali to'y pag nadito yung mga pamangkin ko.
Kanya-kanya nyan dalan ng computer,
kanya-kanya nyan set up ng PC dito sa bahay,
tapos na-herpa sila.
So kanya-kanya sila PC.
Pero para mi ma,
Celestia, say kung kanyari mag-sabay-sabay sila, ilang tatlong AC po ba siya?
Natig to two horsepower?
So dalawang AC natigwa one horsepower,
tapos yung sa kwarto ko is two horsepower,
and dito sa baba 2.5.
Pero rarely naman sabay-sabay po lahat yun?
Rarely.
Pero once na pumunta dito yung mga pamangkin ko diba, pag ganyan,
like nakaraan summer, nandito sila.
Kasi mainito sa kanila, so dito sila.
Tapos sabay-sabay pa nang bukas ng PC,
so nagalaro sila dito, nagiging online gaming sila dito.
So kamusta naman ang koreyente ko, diba?
Kasi masabay pa ako.
So, and then itong-tong coming Christmas vacation malamang nandito yung mga yan.
Sige ma'am, ma'am ganto, padalan kita ng 5, 6, 8 kasi malaki talaga yung binabarong,
kahit yung 8 kilowatt namin, baka something lang that you may want to consider,
just a view lang or reference ma'am.
Yun ang ano, so nakita ko na yan eh, yung ki Ivy, pinadala niya sa kanyong quotation.
O, meron siya. Na una na yung quotation niya, which is good kasi nakita ko na.
Ang ano ko dun is, I'm kind of torn between 6 and 8, alam nga yun?
So silang inaano ko dun. I mean okay lang naman sa amin, bayaran ko kahit kode siya, diba?
It's just like, I want to make sure na pag nandito yung mga lala na dito sa umaga, yung mga bata,
I mean, hindi sila, masalaking bayaran ko sa miral ko.
Actually ma'am, assuming natatakbo si 2.5, si 2 ang 1 horsepower plus yung isang 2 horsepower, that's a total of 6.5 already.
So at least an 8 kilowatt system to cover that. Yun siya ma'am.
Pero again, you may want to check kung anong mas mag-work po sa inyo or if you have a budget that we are set already.
But the usage ng gano'n kung sabay-sabay sila ma'am, kasi based on our experience palaga, may mga client kami na hindi kami mag-air ko sa umaga, isa lang.
Pero kung naka-solder na gini or nui, kasi naka-solder na, so yun lang ma'am.
That's something that you may want to consider. I'll have, if you have already the 8 kilowatt system, you may want to reconsider also.
But again, you can always start small.
So yan, so pinagpipila ko talaga 6 and 8. And like I said, matagal na rin kayo sa industry, maayos naman yung mga reviews sa inyo, maganda rin naman.
Thank you.
So yeah, so I mean, I know both solders are very popular. They're very popular.
You know, maayos ni sila gumawa. It's just like, hindi ko ano yung...
Legio hindi maganda yung offer, so...
Dabi na lang natin gano'n, hindi ko nagusang sabi ko, for this much...
So ako nga, for this 5.18 kilowatt, how much? Alam mo yung gano'n?
So I mean, yung binigay nila sa aking quotation, hindi nga pumalu ng...
Wala kasi nabinigay nila sa aking quotation ni N.E. for consideration like 6 kilowatt or 8 kilowatt.
It's just like naging naglaro lang sa 5, 5.08, 5.18, yung gano'n lang yung binigay nila sa aking quotation.
But like they said, I can always go higher if I want to.
It's just like considering na mas bagadang offer nyo, I might as well go with...
Thank you po.
So yung padating na...
Eto sabi ko sayo, yung permahan ng...
Since bagi-inspect naman dito, diba?
Pani bang yung permahan ng contract is dito na lang sa bahay?
Yes ma'am, opo, pwede naman po.
So if we are already decided ma'am, you just have to send us a photo of your valid ID.
Para pag-inspection na po, sabay na tayo sa contract signing if you like.
Question, ano kasi valid photo ID ang kailangan nyo?
Kasi dito sa Pilipinas para ka makakuha ng valid photo ID, kailangan mo ng valid photo ID.
Passport, license, yung mga gano'n ma'am.
Okay, teen, okay lang yung teen.
Pwede naman teen, accepted na siya ngayong.
Kasi wala akong ano eh, wala ako.
Pero yung sa teen ko, yung old house address ko yun.
Eto kasi bagong bahay, okay?
Yes ma'am.
I just want to make sure it clarify ko lang.
Kasi wala akong Pilipin passport kasi.
Ah, okay.
U.S. passport lang.
Okay po.
Sige ma'am, okay lang po.
So kasi nga lagi siya, may password kayo?
Ah, hindi mo tatanggap.
Kasi ano eh, wala akong pasport eh, wala akong passport eh.
Pero hindi Pilipin passport, alam nga yun.
Yeah, so ano lang, kasi ano meron ako?
Teen, national ID.
National ID ma'am.
Pwede yun?
Mas valid.
Ah, sige, sige.
Sikandari si teen.
Si teen.
Ah, sige.
Pero yung address ko din doon, yung old house ko para yun.
Yes, okay lang po.
Just wanna make sure ah, si teen bagong bahay.
Ang bagong bahay ma'am, is yung 2157, yung district.
Yes.
Okay.
Alright, sige ma'am.
Para yun kasi po yung ilalagay sa contract.
Yeah, a'o.
Ito, ito yung, yan yung tamang address.
Yan yung ilalagay ng solar.
Ah, okay.
Sige po ma'am.
Alright, sige ma'am.
So I'll have, I'll have ID na lang po ma'am reach out.
I think you are communicating via email po.
So let us know na lang ma'am which one you will prefer, the six kilowatt or eight kilowatt.
Para at least we can prepare the contract for you po.
And then your ID na lang po ma'am.
Okay.
And then one more question.
So po nagfirmahan ng signing contract dito, kailangan kong i-deposit yung cheque sa bank
ko, pwede kong ibigay dun sa magpipapa sa akin?
Pwede po.
Pwede po yung cheque.
Cheque?
A-a.
Okay.
Ibigay dun sa project manager namin, yes ma'am.
Alright, perfect.
Kasi ayoko lang pumunta ng bank ko.
I know ma'am.
Parang ganyan lahat na lang ng ID hingin.
Toto'o yan ma'am.
Araw-araw niya ko na ikita dito, harali niya ko.
Toto'o ma'am.
Toto'o talaga yan.
Kahit dun ko talaga de-depositor.
Napangangasal kung punta ng bank ko dito.
Di ko gusto.
Not always.
Not as big kilala ko dun.
It's not a pleasant experience going to the bank.
It's always a lie.
Antagal-tagal.
Ano bang bango mo ma'am?
BPI?
BDO?
Ayan.
Kaya pala.
Toto'o yan ma'am.
Sobrang taga lang yung ATM ko.
Hanggang ngayon.
Di ko pa rin magami.
Di ko magami.
Pin.
Niya nga.
Niya nga.
Niya nga.
Niya nga.
Niya nga.
Niya nga.
Niya nga.
Niya nga.
Niya nga.
Niya nga.
Niya nga.
Niya nga.
Niya nga.
Niya nga.
Anyway, that's beside a different story for another day.
But anyway, so I'll make a decision.
Probably, let me think about it for a day.
Yeah, sure.
No worries.
And then reach out to Ivy, which I would prefer to the solar.
Which one?
Package?
Yeah.
Sure, no worries.
One more question.
So sa premium, anong gagamitin yung solar panel?
That's the Pono Solar, ma'am, which offers the 20 years product warranty.
That's a long time.
Yeah.
Okay na yun.
Maganda na yun.
So anyway, so I'll do that.
I'll think about it.
I'll email Ivy or message her on Facebook.
Is that okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, you can do that, ma'am.
So that's for my decision.
And then we can go there.
All right.
Well, that's great to hear, po.
Again, thank you for choosing Aces Solar, Miss Ivy.
Have a great day, po.
And thank you for your time.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Bye-bye, ma'am.
She didn't have her faces except Ivy.
She didn't have her camera.
Okay.
Thank you, po.
Bye-bye.
Have a great day.
Bye-bye.
Likewise, ma'am.
Thank you.
Get this.
Bye-bye.
Oh, Ivy.
